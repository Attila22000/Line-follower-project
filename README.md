# Line-follower-project


Adding a comment to this file so there is a new commit i can push - Attila


The main objectives of this project are:

Test the capabilities of the EV3 robot
Document the process of writing the line follower and obstacle avoidance code
To provide retrospective feedback on our previous work

We are using Java version 1.7 for the coding process using the Eclipse IDE with a EV3 Plugin.

At the same time, we are using version control to share our code among teammates and avoid possible code losses.

Here is a line to push.
